# Simplify

Streamline code by removing redundancy and aligning with repo style.

## Steps

1. Identify redundant logic, unnecessary indirection, or repeated patterns
2. Consolidate or refactor to smaller, clearer units with meaningful names
3. Align structure and formatting with existing repo conventions
4. If input is provided, apply changes only within the specified target

## Notes

- Prefer minimal, behavior-preserving changes unless input requests otherwise
