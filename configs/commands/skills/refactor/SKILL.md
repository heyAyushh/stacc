# Refactor Code

Improve code quality while maintaining the same functionality.

## Code Quality Improvements

- Extract reusable functions or components
- Eliminate code duplication
- Improve variable and function naming
- Simplify complex logic and reduce nesting

## Performance Optimizations

- Identify and fix performance bottlenecks
- Optimize algorithms and data structures
- Reduce unnecessary computations
- Improve memory usage

## Maintainability

- Make code more readable and self-documenting
- Add appropriate comments where needed
- Follow SOLID principles and design patterns
- Improve error handling and edge case coverage
